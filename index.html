          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>

          <li>You can change the color with the identifier code.</li>
          <li>You need to link the style css page to the head of your code in order for it to be recognized.</li>
          <li> Think of CSS as a box diagram and padding is the space surrounding that box and margin is the space your box is from the edge of the page.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript reads code top to bottom in a linear fashion. Code needs to be in order.</li>
          <li>You can used conditional statements and loops to control the order in which the code is executed.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>An if statement is a way of introducing decision-making into our code.</li>
          <li>The strict equality operator (===) checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a Boolean result true if the values are equal and false if the values are not equal.</li>
          <li>When the computer checks the conditions in the if statement, topic === 'HTML' evaluates to truthy, and so the code block, console.log("Let's study HTML!") is executed.</li>
          <ii>Interrupting the control flow allows us to build apps that respond to a user's actions.</ii>
          <li>Being able to store a group of data in an array is a fundamental feature of JavaScript. Arrays are especially useful when we want to perform a task on multiple pieces of data at once.</li>
          <li>That is because Lu is a string, and strings need to be contained within quotation marks. Since 54 is a number and true is a Boolean value, no quotation marks are necessary for those values. As you can see, this array contains a string, a number, and a Boolean value.</li>
          <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li>The first index in an array is always 0.</li>
          <li>At the most basic level, a function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
          <li>A function's name is followed by parentheses (). Later on, we will define parameters that can be placed inside the parentheses. For now, just remember that it is important to include the parentheses whenever you write a function.</li>
          <li>Remember to include the empty parentheses after the function name. Note that it is common practice to indent the for loop code below the function name, within the curly brackets, to add visual structure to your code.</li>
